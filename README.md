# DigitalSteering
Please note that this guide assumes you have Python installed on your system.

Step 1: Install Python
Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. If not, you can download it from the official Python website.

Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)
bash
Copy code
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv myenv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows
myenv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source myenv/bin/activate
Step 3: Install Required Modules
bash
Copy code
# Install required modules
## pip install mediapipe
## pip install opencv-python
## pip install ctypes

Step 4: Download the Code
Download or clone the code from the repository. If it's a single file, save it with the extension .py, for example, steering_code.py.

Step 5: Run the Code
bash
Copy code
# Run the code
python steering_code.py
Step 6: Observe Hand Gestures
Once the code is running, it will use your webcam to capture frames. It tracks hand gestures, and based on the gestures, it simulates key presses for turning left, turning right, going left aggressively, going right aggressively, and keeping straight.

Step 7: Terminate the Program
To stop the code, press q in the terminal where the code is running.

Feel free to customize the code based on your preferences or integrate it into your project as needed.
