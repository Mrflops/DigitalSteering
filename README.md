Step 6: Observe Hand Gestures

Once the code is running, it will use your webcam to capture frames. It tracks hand gestures, and based on the gestures, it simulates key presses for turning left, turning right, going left aggressively, going right aggressively, and keeping straight.

## Terminate the Program
To stop the code, press q in the terminal where the code is running.

Feel free to customize the code based on your preferences or integrate it into your project as needed.


Steering Digitally :D
